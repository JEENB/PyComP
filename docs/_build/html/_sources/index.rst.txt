PyComP - Python Compression Library
===================================

PyComP is a Python library for compressing and decompressing data. It provides a simple and efficient way to reduce the size of data files without losing any information.

Features
--------

PyComP has a range of features that make it a powerful tool for data compression:

- **Supports multiple algorithms:** PyComP supports several compression algorithms, including Huffman, Arithmetic, Range, ABS and ANS, which can be selected based on your specific requirements.
- **Customizable compression level:** PyComP allows you to specify the compression level, which determines the balance between compression ratio and speed. Higher levels result in smaller file sizes but slower processing times.
- **Easy-to-use functions:** PyComP provides a range of convenient functions for compressing and decompressing data and files.

Installation
------------

Installing PyComP is quick and easy! You can use pip to install it directly from the command line:
